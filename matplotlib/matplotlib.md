# Introduction to Matplotlib

## Matplotlib's Pyplot Interface

### Transfor Datasets into Visualizations

Types of datasets include:
* Pandas DataFrames
* Lists, tuples and dictionaries
* NumPy arrays

Types of visualizations include:
* Bar charts
* Pie charts
* Line charts
* Scatter plots

The Pyplot Module = The heart of Matplotlib
* Accepts many forms of input values.
* Enables custom colors, shapes, labels, etc.

General Plotting Process Using Pyplot
1. Create your dataset. Data can be generated from functions, pulled from Pandas DataFrames, etc.
2. Generate your plot. Use the pyplot.plot() function to tell Matplotlib what data to use and which plot to make.
3. Customize your plot. Change the axis, label the figurs, color the data points -make the plot as informative to the reader as possible.
